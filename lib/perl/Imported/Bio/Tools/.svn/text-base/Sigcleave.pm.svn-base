# _History_
#
# Object framework ripped from Steve Chervits's SeqPattern.pm
# 
# Core EGCG Sigcleave emulation from perl code developed by
# Danh Nguyen & Kamalakar Gulukota which itself was based 
# loosely on Colgrove's signal.c program.
#
# The overall idea is to replicate the output of the sigcleave
# program which was distributed with the EGCG extension to the GCG sequence
# analysis package. There is also an accessor method for just getting at
# the raw results.

=head1 NAME

Bio::Tools::Sigcleave.pm - Bioperl object for sigcleave analysis

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Object Creation

    use Bio::Tools::Sigcleave ();

    $sigcleave_object = new Bio::Tools::Sigcleave(-file=>'sigtest.aa',
                                                  -desc=>'test sigcleave protein seq',
                                                  -type=>'AMINO',
                                                  -threshold=>'3.5',
                                                 );

Sigcleave objects can be created via the same methods as Bio::Seq objects. The
one additional parameter is "-threshold" which sets the score reporting limit
for the algorithim. The above exmple shows a sigcleave object being created
from a protein sequence file. See the Bio::Seq documention to see the other ways
that objects can be created.

=head2 Object Methods & Accessors

     %raw_results      = $sigcleave_object->signals;

     $formatted_output = $sigcleave_object->pretty_print;

=head1 INSTALLATION

This module is included with the central Bioperl distribution:

   http://bioperl.org/Core/Latest
   ftp://bioperl.org/pub/DIST

Follow the installation instructions included in the README file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Sigcleave" was a program distributed as part of the free EGCG add-on to
earlier versions of the GCG Sequence Analysis package. 

From the EGCG documentation:
  SigCleave uses the von Heijne method to locate signal sequences, and to identify 
  the cleavage site. The method is 95% accurate in resolving signal sequences from 
  non-signal sequences with a cutoff score of 3.5, and 75-80% accurate in identifying 
  the cleavage site. The program reports all hits above a minimum value. 

The EGCG Sigcleave program was written by Peter Rice 
(E-mail: pmr@sanger.ac.uk Post: Informatics Division, The Sanger Centre,
Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambs, CB10 1SA, UK). 

Since EGCG is no longer distributed for the latest versions of GCG, this code
was developed to emulate the output of the original program as much as possible for
those who lost access to sigcleave when upgrading to newer versions of GCG.

There are 2 accessor methods for this object. "signals" will return a perl
associative array containing the sigcleave scores keyed by amino acid position.
"pretty_print" returns a formatted string similar to the output of the original
sigcleave utility.

In both cases, the "threshold" setting controls the score reporting level. If no
value for threshold is passed in by the user, the code defaults to a reporting value
of 3.5. 

In this implemntation the accessor will never return any score/position pair which does not
meet the threshold limit. This is the slightly different from the behaviour of
the 8.1 EGCG sigcleave program which will report the highest of the under-threshold
results if nothing else is found.



Example of pretty_print output:

	SIGCLEAVE of sigtest from: 1 to 146

	Report scores over 3.5
	Maximum score 4.9 at residue 131

	 Sequence:  FVILAAMSIQGSA-NLQTQWKSTASLALET
        	    | (signal)    | (mature peptide)
          	118            131

	 Other entries above 3.5

	Maximum score 3.7 at residue 112

	 Sequence:  CSRQLFGWLFCKV-HPGAIVFVILAAMSIQGSANLQTQWKSTASLALET
         	   | (signal)    | (mature peptide)
           	99            112


=head1 USAGE

No warranty implied or expressed. Use at your own risk :) Users unfamiliar
with the original Sigcleave application should read the von Heijne papers. 

The emphasis here is on correctly replicating the calls that 8.1 EGCG sigcleave
would make. This code has been tested against a non-redundant curated set
of 405 Swissprot proteins representing secreted, non-secreted, membrane and
transit proteins. Except for the EGCG sigcleave habit of reporting an
under-threshold score if nothing better is found the output was identical.

The weight matrix in this code is for eukaryote signal sequences.

Please see the example script located in the bioperl distribution
to see how this code can be used.

## Now we calculate the _real_ values for the weight table
##
##
## yeah yeah yeah there is lots of math here that gets repeated
## every single time a sigcleave object gets created. This is
## a quick hack to make sure that we get the scores as accurate as 
## possible. Need all those significant digits....

## suggestions for speedup aproaches welcome
