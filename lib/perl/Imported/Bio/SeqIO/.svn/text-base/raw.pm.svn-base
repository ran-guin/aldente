# _History_
#
# Ewan Birney <birney@ebi.ac.uk> developed the SeqIO 
# schema and the first prototype modules.
#
# This code is based on his Bio::SeqIO::Fasta module with
# the necessary minor tweaks necessary to get it to read
# and write raw formatted sequences made by
# chris dagdigian <dag@sonsorol.org>
#
# October 18, 1999  Largely rewritten by Lincoln Stein

=head1 NAME

Bio::SeqIO::raw - raw sequence file input/output stream

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not use this module directly.  Use it via the L<Bio::SeqIO> class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object can transform Bio::Seq objects to and from raw flat
file databases.

=head2 next_seq

 Title   : next_seq
 Usage   : $seq = $stream->next_seq()
 Function: returns the next sequence in the stream
 Returns : Bio::Seq object
 Args    :


=cut

sub next_seq{
   my ($self,@args) = @_;
   ## When its 1 sequence per line with no formatting at all,
   ## grabbing it should be easy :)

   my $nextline = $self->_readline();

=head2 write_seq

 Title   : write_seq
 Usage   : $stream->write_seq($seq)
 Function: writes the $seq object into the stream
 Returns : 1 for success and 0 for error
 Args    : Bio::Seq object


=cut

}

=head2 write_qual

 Title   : write_qual
 Usage   : $stream->write_qual($seq)
 Function: writes the $seq object into the stream
 Returns : 1 for success and 0 for error
 Args    : Bio::Seq object


=cut
