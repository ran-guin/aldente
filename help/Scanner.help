<h2>Using the Symbol SDK3700 Barcode Scanner</h2>
    
<Img src='$Help_Image_dir/Scanner.png'> 
<P>	
	    For the time being there are a couple of limitations on the
scanner that will hopefully be resolved in the future.
<UL><LI>There is no back button (don't try to use it - or you will lose your
place)
<LI>You need to currently use the pen. <BR>
(Again, it is hoped that we can set it up to work without the pen, but this
will take a bit longer to set up)
</UL>

<H3>To access the barcode website:</H3><UL>
    <LI>Turn on the scanner (red key at bottom left)
        <LI>click on Internet Explorer (drop down menu at top left of screen)
	    <LI>click on the folder ('Favorites')icon at the bottom of the screen
	        <LI>click on the file 'scanner' (while it loads the explorer
icon should be visible at the top right of the screen)
    <LI>Identify yourself and press the 'Login' button</UL>

    <UL>
        <LI>Go to 'File Explorer' (from drop-down menu at top left)
	    <LI>select 'ScanWedge' from list of files (this should
initialize the scanner)

top left) and continue</UL>

   <h3>Warm Booting</h3>
	<B>If the system is really hung up badly, try a Warm Re-Boot<br>
	(press the A4 and Scroll Button at the same time).<BR>
	If this still does not work, a cold boot may be necessary <BR>
	- See Below (though you should probably check with admin first)</B>
	
	   <h3>Cold Booting</h3>
	   	    <P>

		 <p>
		 <h2>Re-Initializing after a Re-Boot</h2>
		  If you need to perform a full cold reboot, the
configuration settings may have to be reset.<bR>
The following procedure should set the unit back up to operate properly:

<OL>
<LI>Start | Settings | Connections | Network
<LI>Select Spectrum24 Wireless LAN PC Card
   <UL><LI>enter the IP address from the sticker on the back <BR>
   (e.g. 10.1.1.152 for ppt02) - NOT the IP address from the bridge
(10.1.1.150)
    <LI>subnet mask is 255.255.255.0
        <LI>default gateway is 10.1.1.1
	    <LI>hit OK in top right of screen
	        </UL>
		<LI>Select NE2000 Compatible Ethernet Driver
		    <UL><LI>enter the IP address from the sticker on the back
		            <LI>subnet mask is 255.255.255.0
			            <LI>default gateway is 10.1.1.1
				            <LI>select the Name Servers tab
					            <LI>enter 10.1.1.8 in
the DNS field - leave other fields blank
        <LI>hit OK in top right of screen
	</UL>
	RF:
	
	<PRE>
	
	1. Start | Programs
	2. Run NICTT
	3. Select the 'General' tab
	4. Enter 102 in the ESSID field. This is the network ID for the bridge
	
	
	TURN UNIT OFF
	TURN UNIT ON
	
	1. Start | Programs
	2. Run NICTT
	3. Select the 'Signal' tab
	    - the signal quality should be 'Excellent'
	        - the network status should be 'In range'
		    - if the unit is not networked - CHECK WITH SYS SUPPORT
		    4. Select the 'Transmission' tab
		    5. Enter 10.1.1.8 in the Host Address box
		    6. Hit 'Start Test'
		        - this will begin pinging the file server to test
the unit's networking
    - it should proceed without trouble giving an average return time of
200-400 ms.
    - if you get any other significantly different results CHECK WITH SYS
SUPPORT

Checking Status From A Workstation (optional)

1. open a console
2. ping the pocket pc you just set up
    - ping IP where IP is the address assigned previously (e.g. ping
10.1.1.152 for ppt02)
    - the standard values for the return times should be around 200-400ms.
    
    This unit responds SLOWLY
        - if you get any other significantly different results CHECK WITH
SYS SUPPORT
