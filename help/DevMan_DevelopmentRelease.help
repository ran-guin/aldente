<h2>LIMS Developer's Manual - Development/Release Cycle<br>
</h2>
The LIMS system has a monthly development cycle and it consists of the
following 4 phrases (assuming 30 days per month):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Requirement Review (15% of time; 1st to 5th of the month) </li>
  <li>Design (15% of time; 4th to 9th of the month)</li>
  <li>Development (40% of time; 5th to 22nd of the month)</li>
  <li>Integration and Test (30% of time; 22nd to 30th of the month)</li>
</ul>
It is possible that there are overlaps between 2 phrases. <br>
<br>
(Note: For details on terminologies used for issues tracking, please
refer to the <a
 href="$homelink&amp;User=Auto&amp;Search+for+Help=Help&amp;Help=Issues">Issues
Tracker help file</a>.)<br>
<h3>Requirement Review </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Any new features should be entered and tracked in the Issues
Tracker as an Enhancement with Priority and Severity assigned.</li>
  <li>For features requested by users, there should always be a review
with the users.</li>
  <li>For features requested by developers:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If priority is Critical/High and/or severity is Fatal/Major,
there should be a review by another developer.</li>
    <li>If severity is Minor/Cosmetic, the review is optional.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>For features that are requested after this stage:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Features that require a lot of coding will be deferred to the
next development cycle.</li>
    <li>Features that do not require a lot of coding or features that
are related to an existing feature request will be implemented in the
current development cycle.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Design </h3>
<ul>
  <li>For features that have priority of Critical/High and/or severity
of Fatal/Major, the design should be reviewed by another developer.</li>
  <li>For features that are very straight forward the design phase can
be skipped.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Development</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Codes that are more complicated should be reviewed by another
developer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Integration and Test</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All new features should be throughoutly tested.</li>
  <li>Features that have priority of Critical/High and/or severity of
Fatal/Major should be briefly tested by another developer as well.</li>
  <li>All defects found within this phrase should be submitted to the
Issues Tracker right the way with Priority and Severity assigned.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Defects that have priority of Critical/High must be fixed
before the release.</li>
    <li>Defects that have priority of Medium/Low will be deferred to
the next release.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Refer to the <a
 href="$homelink&amp;User=Auto&amp;Search+for+Help=Help&amp;Help=Testing_Protocol">Testing
Protocol</a> help page for details on what should be tested and how the
testing should be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A release will be made monthly in the beginning of the month.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A release will only be made if there are no outstanding
Critical/High defects found in the Beta Version for the last 0.5 days.</li>
  <li>A release will only be made before noon so that developers will
still be around to deal with issues that arised from the new release.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedures for Release Process and Ongoing Development </h2>
<ul>
  <li>The steps for the release process are as follows (assuming the
new release is release 2.30 and will be tagged&nbsp;seqdb01-2_30 while
the old release is release 2.20):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn off all cron jobs in seqdb01, lims-dbm, plebe and plebe2
that are run by 'sequence' and 'aldente' users (this is required for
upgrades that takes a long time; otherwise can be skipped)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Login as the 'aldente' user</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Under <span style="font-weight: bold;">/opt/alDente/versions/</span>:<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a copy of the svn trunk as a branch called seqdb01-2_30-branch</li>
	<ul>
	<li>svn copy http://svn/lims/alDente/trunk http://svn/lims/alDente/branches/seqdb01-2_30-branch</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Check out the new branch to the new seqdb01-2_30 folder <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">seqdb01-2_30</span> folder: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>svn checkout http://svn/lims/alDente/branches/seqdb01-2_30-branch seqdb01-2_30</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Make sure that the checkout used the appropriate branch</li>
	<ul>
	<li>svn info seqdb01-2_30</li>
	</ul>
      <li>Generate the system configuation file:<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>install/setup.pl</li>
        <li>ensure the sql database hosts are set correctly (in this
case SQL_HOST should be set to the master host seqdb01)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Backup the production database by running (this is required
if the database upgrade is invasive - just to be safe):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>bin/backup_DB.pl -h seqdb01 -D sequence -u viewer -p viewer
-P /home/sequence/alDente/dumps/sequence.pre-2_30 &gt;
/opt/alDente/www/dynamic/logs/sequence.pre-2_30.backup.log</li>
        <li>Verify the dumps are actually created</li>

      </ul>
      <li>After upgrade is done, test to make sure page is still
working (Perhaps restore a seqtest database to do extensive testing)</li>
      <li>Turn the cron jobs in seqdb01, lims-dbm, plebe and plebe2 run

    <li>Send email notification to lab users about the new release.</li>

  <li>Ongoing development (under <span style="font-weight: bold;">/opt/alDente/versions/)</span>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>New code development (development stream):</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Now that release 2.30 is out, say you are starting to work on
new features for release 2.30. &nbsp;Assuming your ongoing code
development folder is <span style="font-weight: bold;">achan</span>,
make sure you have the latest code - under <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">/opt/alDente/versions/achan/</span>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>svn update</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Develop code and commit changes to Subversion as usual.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Hotfixes/maintenance on existing production version (production
stream):</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Say there is now a bug in the production version requiring a
hotfix. &nbsp;First make sure the <span style="font-weight: bold;">hotfix</span>
folder contains the latest code from the current production branch -
under <span style="font-weight: bold;">/opt/alDente/versions/test/</span>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>svn update</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Make the require coding changes, test the changes and then
svn commit the changes.</li>
      <li>Now it's time to put your hotfix into the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">production</span> folder. To be absolutely
safe about the changes to be applied, first do an svn diff to find out
the changes to be applied (say the file that was changed is
cgi-bin/barcode.pl) - under&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">/opt/alDente/versions/production/</span>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>svn diff cgi-bin/barcode.pl</li>
        <li>svn status cgi-bin/barcode.pl -u</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>If the changes look OK, then update the code in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">production</span> folder - under&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">/opt/alDente/versions/production/</span>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>svn update cgi-bin/barcode.pl</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After making sure the production version is ok, it is crucial
that you also merge the same hotfix changes to the development stream.
&nbsp;The sooner you do the merge, the lower the chance a conflict will
occur.
    </ul>
