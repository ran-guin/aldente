<h2>Last 24 Hours View</H2>
<Span class=small>
<P>The standard run summary view has altered slightly with the following changes:
<UL>
<LI>New column indicating <B>'Validation'</B> status (Approved / Rejected / Pending)
<BR>(<B>Billable</B> status indicated in the same column as above (Yes / No)
<BR>(This column is also colour coded to draw attention to the validation status (Green = Accepted; Yellow = Pending; Red = Rejected)
<LI><B>Plate Class</B> indicated beside Plate_Number ('(St)' : Standard; '(Re)' : ReArray; '(Ol)' = Oligo)
<LI><B>Reloaded Plates</B> are indicated beside the Run Map ('R(2/2)' indicates that this is the second of 2 plates of a reloaded plate)<BR>
	('R+(2/2) indicates that this plate was reloaded as another plate - indicating probably re-prepping)
<LI>A Checkbox is also added at the left to allow <B>selection of Runs for setting Validation / Billable status, or to select certain runs for re-analysis</B>.
<BR>(The execution of these options is only available to lab administrators)
<LI>Above this display there are also new links to allow administrators to <B>re-mirror individual sequencers</B>.

<h2>Protocol Summary</H2>
<P>In addition to the 'Prep Summary' which is customized to show pipeline status information for the Sequencing Lab, we have added a <B>'Protocol Summary'</B> link, which displays a summary of Lab Protocols executed (organized by Library and Plate/Tube Number). 
<P>
<Img src='$Help_Image_dir/ProtocolSummary1.png'>
<P>
Any of the retrieved Protocols may then be clicked on to view the status for <B>each of the steps in the specified protocol</B>.
