<P>
To ensure that stock supplies remain
conservative, when a new catalog number is entered into the database,
administrators have the option of specifying a 'minimum number of units' for
this item.  If stock falls below this value, notification will be sent to
indicate that this item needs to be resupplied
<P>

In addition, when new
chemicals/reagents are added, the user will be shown the current stock
supply of that item (showing the number of Unopened, Open and Finished
Bottles)
<P>

This allows stocks of
Reagents & Chemicals to be monitored regularly.  If a particular item is low
on stock, an e-mail notification is sent to re-supply the item, showing the
current available bottles in stock
