<H1>New Changes</H1>

<UL>
<Img Src='/SDB/images/png/admin.png'><BR>
<LI><H2><B>Admin Page</B></H2>
This page allows lab administrators direct access to a variety of tasks:
<UL>
<LI>Chemistry Calculator
<LI>Protocol Editing
<LI>Machine Default specifications (NEW)
<LI>Dye Chemistry default settings (NEW)
<LI>Add New Project
<LI>Re-Analyze Runs - this will provide the command required to re-run
analysis that can be cut an pasted onto a terminal screen (run as 'sequence')
</UL>

<LI><H2><B>Tube Handling</B></H2>
We can now track Library Tubes through various stages including:
<UL>
<LI>Dilution
<LI>Electro-poration
<LI>Plating to Agar
<LI>Picking (this part has yet to be fully implemented)
</UL>
 <P>
Short cuts allow users to simply scan a tube and solutions, checking for:
<UL>
<LI>SOC media, cells (if Tube has NOT been Electro-porated)
<LI>Water (if Tube is to be Diluted)
<LI>appropriate Antibiotic, Inducer, Substrate if Plate has been Electro-porated
but not yet 'Plated' to Agar
</UL>

<LI><H2><B>Extended Rack Location monitoring</B></H2>
Users should now be scanning more specific locations (racks) rather than
simply selecting '-80 degrees' (for example).  <P>
Users may now move objects by simply scanning any number of plates and/or
solutions along with a rack.<P>
Racks themselves may be moved by scanning them along with a new Freezer.
<P>
To generate new rack barcodes, simply scan the appropriate Equipment
(Freezer), and specify the number of new Rack barcodes to be created.<BR>
Barcodes will come in pairs - one including Equipment location, condition
info, and another in large type that is more easily visible.<BR>
BOTH barcodes should be placed on a rack, and the condition barcode
reprinted when a Rack is moved.

<LI><H2><B>More Sequencing information</B></H2>
<P>
We are now storing information on vectors that were found using cross match,
(screened against the sequence during the original analysis).  This information has been back updated for all runs in the database.<P>
There is also another table that keeps track of contamination found as a result of blasting ecoli against the sequence.  This has also been back-updated to show ecoli findings in all previous runs.<P>
In the future, we can set up something to notify lab administrators of instances of these findings which may warrant further investigation.

<LI><H2><B>Minor Adjustments:</B></H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hyperlinks from 'Current Plates' and 'Plate Set' lists at top of page
<LI>Ensure 'Current Plate Set' order is as defined originally in plate set
<LI>Allow Test Status & No Grows to be set for plate simultaneously
<LI>Allow identical plates to be used for NEW plate set when re-processing
same original plates (for re-performing a protocol using the same original plates)
</UL>

</UL>
