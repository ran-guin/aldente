<h2>Ongoing Development</h2>
<P>
Since the system has largely been developed during the acquisition of large quantities of high throughput sequencing data, the priority has been on ensuring that elements of the system in constant use are functioning correctly.  In many cases, improvements to the general look and feel of the system as well as its level of sophistication are constantly undergoing development.  Feedback from users is not only encouraged in this regard, but of fundamental importance.  Please feel free to communicate ideas or suggestions as they may arise.
