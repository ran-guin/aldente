The manual may be generated automatically by simply building the components in relatively small html files.

Use the build_help.files file to define the layout of the Manual.
Chapters are automatically built as defined in this file.

Links to the applicable help files are created automatically.

Example:

Chapter: This is a sample chapter:Example_chapter
File1
File2 Description:File2

This would require the original building of two html files: File1.help, File2.help.

Running build_help.pl will then automatically combine these files into a single help file (html file) called 'Example_chapter.chapter.help', which will be labeled: 'This is a sample chapter'.  

(Optionally, a more descriptive label can be used for the individual files if a colon is used to separate this label from the actual filename - eg. File2.help is accessed via the label 'File2 Description'.

It will also combine all Chapters into a large single html file called Manual.help.

A Table of Contents is also automatically generated (TofC.help), which is included in the Manual.help file.
