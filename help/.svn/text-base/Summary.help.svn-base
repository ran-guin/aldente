<H2>Summary Page Options:</H2>
<P>A few options exist on the main Summary Page
to monitor the Sequencing Status.  These are complemented in more detail by
the full suite of data visualization tools handled in the 'dbsummary' module.
(more information on this is available separately)<P>  

On the barcode page itself you have the option to look at:
<p>

<h3>Reads Summary</h3>

From the Summary page, you may get a summary of Reads (showing the total
number of reads, No Grows, Slow Grows, and Warnings), for Libraries or for
Machines.  This can be used to view all data, data over the last two weeks
(separately), or the last two days.<P>

<h3>Prep Summary</h3>

You may also generate a list of plates created in the last couple of weeks
as well as a detailed list of the types (and number) of plates created for
each Plate Number from a given library.  It also shows the number of
Sequencing runs completed with each expected primer, highlighting runs that
have yet to be analyzed.  This is useful in quickly determining which plates
still need to be Sequenced or prepared for sequencing.

<H3>Project Update</H3>
This provides a quick summary of the number of runs and reads generated for
each project.<P>

<H3>Sequencer Status</H3>
This provides a quick rundown of the total number of reads generated by each
sequencer.<P>

<H3>Regenerate Menus</H3>
This option allows you to re-generate the Library pull-down menu to make it
easier to select a choice.  If you choose a specific project and press the
regenerate menus button, the only libraries that will appear in the
pull-down menu will be ones associated with that Project (or Project Type if
it is specified)<p>Some <B>TERMS</B> that may be used include:

<UL>
<LI><B>Quality Length</B> - This is the length of the region determined by Phred
to be of good quality.  It generally will correspond with phred 20 values,
but it determines a region which may include some values below phred 20, and
exclude other short sections with phred values of greater than 20
<LI><B>Quality Vector</b> - This refers to the number of base pairs
identified as Vector within the 'Quality' region determined by Phred (see
above)
<LI><B>Phred 20</B> - The number of base pairs with a phred 20 score or higher
</UL>
