<H2>Fixing data when the wrong plate was defined for use in a sequencing run</H2>

Please follow the following steps in order to properly identify plates that
have been incorrectly specified.

<UL>
<LI>Find plate which was incorrectly scanned or specified (and note where
this occurred. (eg 'Pla1' during 'Step A')
<LI>Find the correct id which should have been scanned or specified. (eg 'Pla2')
<LI>Scan the incorrectly scanned plate and view its history. (in 'edit' mode)
<LI>Change the plate id to the correct id ONLY for preparation steps which:
<UL>
<LI>
identify the plate specifically<BR>
(many will ONLY specify the plate SET - do NOT change these records) 
<LI>AND ... occur AFTER the mis-naming and BEFORE it is transferred on to
another plate.<BR>
(there may not be any if it was transferred right away)
</UL>
<LI>Note the Plate SET number associated with the plate directly AFTER mis-labelling.
<LI>Find any plate sets which include Pla1 (which SHOULD include Pla2 instead).
<LI>Edit the Plate Set as required.<BR>
   (Plate Sets which include daughter plates of Pla2 DO NOT have to be edited)

<LI>IF Pla2 is Transferred to daughter plate(s):
 <UL><LI>Find the target plate (plate it was transferred TO)
     <LI>Edit the target plate to change the details as necessary.<BR>
       (The plateID will remain unchanged, but other details will have to be
changed)<BR>
       ie FKParent_Plate__ID MUST be changed (to 'Pla2') <BR>
       - as well as details such as Parent_Quadrant as necessary
     <LI>(Repeat this process for each subsequent transfer as required).
 </UL>
<LI>Find the Sequence run associated with the mis-entered plate.
<BR>(IF the name of the Sample sheet needs to be changed:)
<UL><LI>Find the Samplesheet directory for the plate (as it SHOULD be named)
<LI>Figure out what the name should be (ie. which version it will be)
<LI>Rename the mis-named samplesheet to the correct name<BR>
(directory will only need to be changed if the Library is different)
<LI>Edit the name in the Sequence table to reflect the new samplesheet name.
<LI>Note that the name has been changed in the Comments field.
<LI>Find the .ab1 files in the mirror directory.  
<LI>Rename the files in this directory as required.
<LI>Re-analyze this run (update_sequence.pl)
</UL>
