<H2>SDB::DB_Form_Viewer.pm</H2>
<P>The DB_Form_Viewer module is designed to act as a form generator for viewing, editing, appending records.
<P>Some of the more useful functions include:
<UL>
<LI>generate_form()
<LI>view_records()
</UL>

<P>By including a line in the beginning of the code something like:

if (DB_Viewer_Branch()) { exit; }
<P>
the module can catch parameters sent from forms generated by the module,
enabling continuing navigation between forms making use of links within the forms,
and buttons supplied by the forms.
