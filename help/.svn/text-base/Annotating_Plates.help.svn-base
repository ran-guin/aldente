<H2>Adding comments or notes</h2>
<p>
Sometimes plates or sequence runs will be failed or annotated with a
comment.  This can be done on a group of plates or sequence runs together by
going to the same page used to delete entries for plates, or to the 'Check
Runs Already Analyzed' for Sequence Runs which have already been analyzed.
An option at the bottom of the page is available for annotating (or marking
as failed), the Plates or Runs selected.
