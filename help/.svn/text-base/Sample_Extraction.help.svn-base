<h1>Sample Extraction</h1>

<h3>Defining a sample extraction step</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As admin, log on to the protocol admin page.</li>
  <li>Either select an existing protocol or create a new protocol for
the extraction step.</li>
  <li>In the screen that accepts inputs for a protocol step:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Select either the Transfer' or 'Aliqout' radio button in the
Step Name section.&nbsp; The difference between the two is a Transfer
assumes all sample within source tube will be extracted, whereas an
Aliquot assumes only part of the sample will be extracted.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Select the target container type from the popup menu.&nbsp;
Right now only tubes are supported.</li>
    <li>Check the 'Transfer/Aliquot/Pool to new sample of type:"
checkbox and select the type of sample to be extracted to the target
tube from the popup menu.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Check the 'Scanner View Enabled' checkbox</li>
    <li>You can also optionally specify the amount to be extracted by
checking the "Amount To Aliqout/Transfer:" checkbox and specify the
amount on the right.<br>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <li>Save the step. Note that the step name will be automatically
generated, with the sample type end up after either the word Transfer
or Aliquot in the step name.&nbsp; For example, if we are extracting
DNA to a 1.5 mL tube, then the step name will be 'Transfer <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DNA</span> to 1.5 mL tube', whereas a
regular transfer will just be 'Transfer to 1.5 mL tube'.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Going through a sample extraction step</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Scan in the source tubes that are to be extracted.</li>
  <li>Save the tubes as a tube set.</li>
  <li>Select the protocol that contains the extraction step.</li>
  <li>In the extraction step page, if extraction amount is specified
then either accepts it or changes it.&nbsp; Clicking on the "Transfer
&lt;sample type&gt; to ......" button will complete the extraction step.<br>
  </li>
  <img src="$Help_Image_dir/Extraction_Step_Usage.png"> <li>A new
original tube will be created along with a barcode.</li>
  <li>The protocol will continue with the next step.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Viewing pooling ancestry</h3>
<ol>
  <li>After the extraction is done, its ancestry can be viewed from the
scan tubes home page.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Scan in one of the source tubes:</li>
    <img src="$Help_Image_dir/Extraction_To_Ancestry.png"> <li>Scan in
the target tube:<br>
    </li>
