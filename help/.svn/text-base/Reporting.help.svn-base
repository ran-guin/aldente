<h2>Generating and Viewing Reports</H2>
<P>

One of the most powerful features of maintaining an organized database of
Lab Processes and Data is that it is possible to generate detailed specific
reports that make monitoring and viewing data easy and informative.
<BR>
Some of the most commonly used Reporting tools include:
<UL>
<LI>Last 24 Hours View <BR>
This view provides a summary of runs generated within the last 24 Hours.
<BR>It provides a quick colour map view of the runs allowing lab
administrators to quickly and easily evaluate run quality over an entire
plate (or group of plates).  It also indicates average phred quality,
component of vector found, as well as various identification details.<BR>
From here one can link directly to various pages providing more information
such as more detailed views of the plate.

<LI>Project Summary <BR>
This allows users to quickly see statistics on Phred 20 quality, Number of
Reads, and Number of Runs completed for each library.  Totals are available
as well by Project, and a histogram displayed showing the general quality
distribution over a library and project.

<LI>Preparation Status <BR>
This allows users to view the current state of a Library, detailing the
status along the production line of all plates originating from the library.
Plates are grouped as well by chemistry to display which chemistries have
been used and which are still in need of processing.  

<LI>DB Summary <BR>
An entire suite of data visualization tools is also available that allow
users to view comprehensive information about sequencing data.  In addition,
users may provide a detailed filter of runs to include specifying machine,
dates, projects, chemistry etc.
