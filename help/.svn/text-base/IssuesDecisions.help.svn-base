<H2>Design Issues & Decisions</H2>
<P>
The fundamental method of driving the application (using perl on a linux platform, utilizing mySQL via a web browser interface), were set out in the original (unofficial) design requirements.  Since then, little time has been available to carefully evaluate these decisions, but in many cases there remains some justification for maintaining them (including simplicity).  Nevertheless, there is the possibility that the system may benefit from making use of some alternatives (such as modperl, python, java, postgres) in the future. It is beyond the scope of this document to perform a detailed justification which excludes these options, except in clarifying a number of inherent benefits of using the platform that we are currently using.
<UL>
<LI>perl - <P>perl is used almost exclusively to drive this application.  Perl provides a very simple yet powerful programming language that enables developers (even without extensive experience with perl), to fairly quickly understand the code. This was originally indicated as preferable due to its ease of use (both by developers, and as a method of generating cgi files dynamically), portability and open source status of a wide range of modules.  Future development may utilize a broader range of utilities such as Java, Python or modperl, but the current system is limited primarily to simple utilities such as custom style sheets and javascript.  One advantage of this (though it may not entirely justify a strategy limiting the use of such utilities), may still be in the increased portability and broader availability to developers (no requirement for fluency in Java to develop application)
  
<LI>mySQL - <P>mySQL is widely recognized as a very powerful and robust database system which is available as open source.  While criticisms are largely focused on its inability (at least until recently) to support foreign keys, this drawback can be addressed by including code which performs integrity checking during all database editing functions.  In some ways this provides developers with even closer control of input/output as they are more intimately in control of (and familiar with) these processes.  Similarly many other features of a more enhanced database language (postgres), can be carried out be developers by writing their own code.  As such, the advantages gained in performance and robustness may outweigh the benefits of these features.  A detailed analysis of this stil needs to take place however, and should be repeated regularly as all of these database platforms are changing regularly. 
<LI>web interface - <P>to provide an interface to the database, a standard web interface is used.  This is much easier than developing a separate application to drive the interface, and has the added simplicity of requiring minimal installation steps in setting up peripheral users on new machines or on hand held scanners.
