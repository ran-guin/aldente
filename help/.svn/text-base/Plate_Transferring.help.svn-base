<H2>Transferring Plates</H2>
Plates may be transferred in a variety of ways:

<UL>
<LI>Direct plate to plate transfer - <BR>
<UL>
<LI>scan any number of plates in the 'scan' field
<LI>choose the target format from the pulldown menu
<LI>press the 'Transfer Plates To' button.<BR>
(by selecting 'Test Only', the plates will be flagged as 'Test' Plates.
</ul>

<LI>Transferring within protocols - <BR>
Often, within a protocol, while working with numerous plates, it is desired
to 'Transfer' (in which it is assumed that the original plate is no longer
active), or 'Aliquot' (in which the original plate is still available for
further 'Aliquot' steps) DNA to new plates.  In this case, the transfer is
completed automatically within the protocol handling.  New barcodes for the
target plates are automatically generated, and a new plate set defined
(consisting of a list of the new plates generated).  If transferring from 96 to
384 well format, the plates are automatically transferred such that each
group of 4 scanned plates is sent to the a,b,c, and d quadrants
of a new  384-well plate. <BR>
Note: in this case, the 384 well plate is actually recorded as 4 96-well
plates co-existing on a single 384 well plate.  This allows the possibility
of having 4 plates from different libraries existing on one 384 well plate.
The new plate will then be identified by a 'Multiple Barcode' consisting of a concatenation of 4 plate ids.

<LI>384-well -> 96-well distribution - <BR>
If the original plate is a 384 well plate, the user may specify the number
of 96-well quadrants that are available (defaults to 4).  In this case, the
user may transfer any specified quadrants (a,b,c or d) as desired to a new
96-well format as chosen from a pulldown menu.  4 target plates will
automatically be created from each 384 well source plate (assuming all
quadrants are transferred), and barcodes printed.
