<h1>Why?</H1>

<h2>WHY does anyone need an integrated database for storing laboratory data ?</H2>
<h2>or WHAT does it do ?</h2> 

Much of the value of the system can be summed up by FAME:
<UL>
<LI>F - Facilitating lab processes
<LI>A - Automating analytical or pedantic tasks
<LI>M - Monitoring of various aspects of laboratory function
<LI>E - Error checking
</UL>

<P>And remember:<P>
<It>"To many fame comes too late"</It> - Louis de Camoens (14th century Portugese poet)
<P>But beware:<P>
<It>"Fame is a constant effort"</It>   - Jules Renard (17th century French writer)

<h2>Facilitating Lab Processes</h2>
<UL>
<LI>auto-generating sequencer 'sample sheets'
<LI>directing lab users to follow laboratory protocols
<LI>providing easy access to data for lab administrators
<LI>providing a simple interface for Data Entry.
</UL>

<h2>Automating analytical or pedantic tasks</h2>
<UL>
<LI>calculating volumes of reagents to be used based on pre-determined formulas
<LI>extracting information quickly about various laboratory items
<LI>analyzing raw data and generating and presenting it in an easily viewed format
<LI>generating detailed reports outlining data results
<LI>generating information for cost reporting
<LI>notifying users/administrators of possible problems
</UL>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<UL>
<LI>tracking plates through laboratory preparation stages
<LI>tracking reagents as they are mixed into solutions and applied to samples
<LI>monitoring stock levels
<LI>monitoring equipment servicing
<LI>monitoring quality levels of resultant data
</UL>

<h2>Error checking</h2>
<UL>
<LI>ensuring correct reagents are used for standard solutions
<LI>ensuring expected primers are applied to library plates
<LI>correlating poor quality data with various aspects of lab
<LI>ensuring data is entered within predefined ways to avoid ambiguity and maintain structure
<LI>generating error messages or warnings for lab administrators in cases where data does not appear as expected.	
</UL>
