<h2>Generating New Library Plates</H2>
Assuming the appropriate Library has been added to the database, 
adding a plate is accomplished by simply clicking on the 'Plates' icon 
and selecting 'Create New Plate'.
<P>
Generally the user will only need to specify the format of the plate, the
size, and the expected storage conditions.

More than one plate can be created simultaneously by specifying a number
at the bottom of the form.
