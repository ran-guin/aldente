<h1>What is a Library ?</H1>
A Library is a source of DNA that comes from a common batch (usually
glycerol stock) that may have been generated internally or supplied by an
outside collaborator.  <BR>From each library a number of plates will
typically be made up each of which should be associated with ONE and ONLY
ONE Library.

<h2>What sort of information do we keep on Libraries</H2>
There is quite a bit of information that we would like to store for each
library, so it would be helpful if you were able to acquire this information
before attempting to create it.  This will remove the necessity of returning
at a later date and adding the information (which can quite easily be
neglected).  In a pinch however, it is possible to create a library with a
minimum of information, if there is a need to generate Plates/Sample Sheets
before further information is available.
<P>
<p>The following information is generally required for the library <Font
color=red>(Mandatory Fields shown in red)</Font>: 
<p>
    <Ul><LI><B><Font color=red>Name</Font></B> - This MUST be 5
alpha-numeric characters.  Though it is nice to keep this name somewhat
meaningful, this is an Identification field, and is not meant to act as a
human-readable reference to a library.  In theory, this could be simply a 5
digit number which, though meaningless to a user, provides the database with
an index to this particular library.  Often the format will be simply two
letters followed by an incrementing number.  (such as 'CN001','CN002' for
the first two Cryptococus Neoformans libraries), though if it is useful, the
positions of numbers and letters is flexible (ie. spgpW or P2001)
    <LI><B><Font color=red>FullName</Font></B> -This is usually set to a
brief, but more meaningful name for the library
    <LI><B><Font color=red>Type</Font></B> -This is usually set to indicate
whether the library is an EST,cDNA or SAGE Library
    <LI><B><Font color=red>Vector</Font></B> - This indicates the vector
that is used.  If this vector is already in the database, no further info is
required.  However, there is information that is also required for the
Vector if it a new one.  If no Vector exists for a given library, use the
Vector Name: 'Test'
    <LI><B>Organism</B> - This indicates the organism from which the library
is created
    <LI><B>Source</B> - This indicates where the library originated (eg Jim
Kronstad, UBC)
    <LI><B>Source Name</B> - This is the name given the library by the
original source listed above
    <LI><B>5Prime_Restriction_Site</B> - This indicates the name of the
Restriction Enzyme if appropriate
    <LI><B>3Prime_Restriction_Site</B> - This indicates the name of the
Restriction Enzyme if appropriate in the 3' direction
    <LI><B>Host</B> - This indicates the Host Cells (eg. SOLR or DH20B)
    <LI><B>Sex</B>
<LI><B>Strain</B>
      <LI><B>Tissue</B>
    <LI><B>Description</B> - a more lengthy description of
what the library is composed of

<h2>How do I define a Library</H2>
A Library can be easily defined by first clicking on the 'Libraries' icon
after logging into the main page.  From here, by clicking on 'Libraries' at
the top of the page, one is given a list of current libraries and given the
option to add a new Library.<BR>
You are then given a form to fill out which will include the information
indicated above.  Generally this should be filled in as completely as
possible.  Though it is sometimes easier to leave information blank at first
with the intention of filling it in at a later date, this is discouraged as
this later step is all too often neglected, and the database remains in part
incomplete.

<h2>How can I view information on a Library?</H2>
By simply clicking on the 'Library' icon at the top of the page, you will be
given a choice to view various items including Libraries at the top of the
page.<BR>Clicking on the 'Libraries' hyperlink will display a list of current
libraries.  (You may from here continue to add, edit or delete projects from
this list).

<h2>How can I change information on a Library?</H2>
By viewing the libraries as indicated above, you will be able to find records
that you would like to update.  From this page, you may then simply click on
the 'Edit Library' button to search and edit Library information as required.
