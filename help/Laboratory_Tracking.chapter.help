<H1>Plate Tracking</H1>
<h2>Defining the Protocol</H2>
Before tracking can take place, a detailed protocol is written up and stored in the database which includes details for each step such as:<UL>
<LI>The name of the step
<LI>The Step number within the protocol
<LI>Whether or not users should be prompted for the step.
<LI>A brief message (to be displayed for each step)
<LI>Detailed instructions that may be made available for each step.
<LI>input required (eg. Equipment, Solution, Comments etc)
<LI>default values (if applicable)
<LI>formatting restrictions (if applicable)
</UL>
<P>The input of this information is handled through the Protocol Administrator page.
<p>

   <h2>Monitoring the Protocol</H2>
        <P>The protocol may be monitored and edited regularly to
ensure that it is always up to date.<BR>
<Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/Protocol_admin.png'>
    <h2>Using the Scanners to document Protocol steps</h2>
        <h3>Scanner Home Page</h3>
	    <P>
	    At the home page of the scanner, the user is
given a number of options including:<UL><LI>Scanning any barcoded item to
get a description of it<LI>Scanning a group of plates to define as a plate
set<LI>Making up a standard batch of Solution I<LI>Making up a standard
batch of Solution II<LI>Retrieving a plate set immediately by entering the
plate set number</UL><P>
      	      <Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/scanner_home.png'>
	<h2>Retrieve or Save Plate Set</h2>
<P>Generally a plates are prepared in groups, with 4, 8 or 16 plates being handled at one time.  To make data storage more efficient, the actions are generally stored for the set as a whole (except when plates within the group are associated with different solutions or equipment).  As such, at the outset, users are asked to either define a plate set (scan any number of plates successively and press the 'Save Plate Set' button), or (if using a previously defined set) scan any plate and recover the plate set associated with that plate.<P> 
	          <h2>Selecting a Protocol</h2>
<P>
The user then selects the Protocol
they wish to use from a popdown menu.<P>Alternatively the user can Display
a plate history (showing all preparation done for the current plate or plate
set)<P>
<Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/plateset_home.png'>
	    <h2>Stepping through the Protocol</h2>
 Through each step of the protocol, the user scans
appropriate Equipment, Reagent etc. as required.  Fields for input are
automatically generated based on the protocol step definitions.<P>
eg: <P>
	      		    <Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/protocol_step.png'>
	<h2>Error Checking</h2>
If formats are required for input, users will get warning messages if trying to enter unexpected values.  This allows possible errors to be detected before they occur.<P>
<Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/prompt_fail.png'>
	
	        <h2>Viewing a plate history</h2>
				<P>
A history of what has
been done for a plate or plate set is available as well to monitor what has
already been tracked showing<UL><LI>The Plate Set Number<LI>The Plate (if a
step relates each plate with a unique piece of equipment)<LI>The Protocol
Name<LI>The Protocol Step Name<LI>The time the procedure was
performed<LI>The user who performed the procedure</UL>
		          <P>
			  <Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/plate_history.png'>
			  
			  <P>
			  
			  <h3>Formats</H3>
<P>
Some of the Protocol Names should be in a specific format so
that they may be handled automatically, such as:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Transfer to NUNC</B><P>
This indicates that plates are to be transferred to another format.<BR>
The format should exactly match the format name for the new format.<BR>
eg.  'Transfer to NUNC' or 'Transfer to Robbins - 96ET'<BR>
(This is ensured by supplying a popdown menu for steps of this type)
<LI><B>Transfer to *</B><P>
This indicates that a popup menu should prompt the user for
the Plate Format type...
<LI><B>..Antibiotic..</B><P>
Anything with the string 'Antibiotic' in the Step Name will check for valid
antibiotic depending upon Vector associated with Plate Libraries.<BR>
The Solution_Name must contain the Antibiotic Specified.<BR>
<LI>Note:<P>Naming conventions should be established by lab administrators, particularly fo steps which they are interested in tracking, since step names may be used to monitor at what stage plate preparation is at within the protocols.
</UL><P>
                          
<h3>Database Structure Info</H3>
<P>
(This information is only relevant to database administrators who may be looking at the raw data within the database).
<P>
The structure of the Protocol Table includes the following specially
formatted fields:<BR>
(The values in these fields are <B>colon delimited </B>and should be
<B>consistent in number & order</B>)
<UL>
<LI>Input<P> - input fields available on form (eg.
'FK_Equipment__ID,FK_Solution__ID,Solution_Quantity')
<LI>Protocol_Defaults<P> - default values if applicable (eg. '::0.5')<BR>
(In this case the Equipment, Solution have no defaults, but the
Solution_Quality defaults to 0.5)
<LI>Input_Format<P> - validation requirements (eg. 'Hydra:BD:')<BR>
(In this case the Equipment must be of type 'Hydra' and the Solution_Name
must contain the string 'BD')
</UL>
(These checks are made in the 'Check_Formats' routine in the 'Process.pm'
module) <P>
There is also a field 'Scanner' which indicates whether this step is to be
tracked.<BR>
(Some steps are part of the protocol, but are not tracked with the
scanner).<P>
There is also a table containing a list of protocols ('Protocol_List').<BR>
It contains a list of all protocol names, the author, as well as the state
of the protocol (Old, Inactive, or Active), and an optional description.
Only those set as 'Active' will appear as options.

			  
<h2>Preparation Summary</h2>
<P>This summary allows lab administrators to monitor where plates are currently located in the pipleline.
<P>Administrators can defined protocol steps which are to be tracked and monitor how many plates have completed each step.<P>
<Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/Prep_Summary2.png'>
<P>
If a Prep_Summary request is made with no library specified, the system looks for all the plates created or 'prepped' in the last 5 days (or any other number of days specified by the user).  It then displays a summary of all of the Library plates of similar number and the status along the pipeline.  If any steps remain uncompleted, the last step completed is highlighted, and a link available to either the plates waiting at this step or the last preparation steps completed for these plates.
<P>
<Img Src='$Help_Image_dir/Recent_Plates.png'>
<P>
In both of the above cases, Administrators are also free to edit the steps which are to be tracked. (corresponding to the columns at the left in the above table).
