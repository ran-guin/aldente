<h2>Annotating records with notes</H2>
<P>	
Sometimes mistakes are made during laboratory procedures that cause
errant records to be placed in the 
database.  These can often be removed from the database.
<p>
<B>Removing invalid plates:</B><BR>
Plates can be removed by going to the 'Plates' page icon and then selecting
the <B>Check Recent Plates</B> Button.  This will bring up plates made by
the same user within the last 7 days. 
<p>
From here users can select any number of plates for deletion <BR>
(you may instead mark plates as failed, or annotate any number of plates
with a common note)
<P>
Note: If any other data points to a plate, you will NOT be able to delete
it.<br>
(if for example a sequence run uses a plate - then you will not be able to
delete that plate).<BR>
<P>
<B>Removing Sequence Requests (sample sheets):</B><BR>
Requests for Sequence Runs can be erased in a similar fashion by going to
the 'Sample Sheets' page and selecting 'Remove Sequence Requests'.  Again
the user will be given a list of all requests that they have made that have
not yet been analyzed.
<P>
<B>Removing Solutions (or Reagents):</B><BR>
Solutions can be deleted in a similar fashion.  By clicking on 'Check my
Recent Solutions', the user may select any number of recently made solutions
for deletion (as long as they have not been used in the meantime).  The same
page allows users to reprint a number of barcodes at the same time.
<P>
<B>Specifying an incorrect Plate prior to sequencing</B><BR>
(see Wrong Plate info..)
