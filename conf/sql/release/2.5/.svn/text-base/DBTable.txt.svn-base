DBTable_ID	DBTable_Name	DBTable_Description	DBTable_Status	Status_Last_Updated	DBTable_Type	DBTable_Title
1	Account	Accounts used for purchasing/ordering	Missing values from the Account Type column - perhaps changed to enum	2002-11-20 15:09:00	General	Account
2	Barcode_Label	Barcode formats used for the scanners	OK	2002-11-20 15:09:00	\N	Barcode_Label
3	Box	Boxes received in the lab	Some boxes have no data at all (box 9 and 10); Some boxes do not have a corresponding box type even only Kit and Supplies are the only enums; also dates for Box_Opened are questionable	2002-11-20 15:09:00	Lab Object	Box
4	Chemistry_Code	Chemistry used for the sequencers	Chemistry_Description not nullable yet a lot of chemistry code have blank description; Terminator and Dye fields have values not belonged to the enum list	2002-11-20 15:09:00	\N	Chemistry_Code
5	Solution	Individual solutions used in the lab	There are solutions with Quantity_Used filled in but without Solution_Quantity;  Also there are solutions that have no solution type; when linked with the Stock table, there are a solutions that belongs to different solution_type for the same stock_name - currently Jeff/George are taking a look at the list to see how it can be cleaned up.;Also whether there should be Solution that does not belong to any Stock.	2002-11-20 15:09:00	Lab Object	Solution
6	Solution_Info	Extra information for solutions used in the lab	The idea of this table is many Solution can share the same Solution_Info.  However, there are a lot of records in the Solution_Info table that have the exact same nMoles, ODs and micrograms, causing redundant information.  The combination of these 3 fields should be unique	2002-11-20 15:09:00	\N	Solution_Info
7	Stock	Stock item in the lab	There are a lot of entries having NO Stock_Catalog_Number even though their Stock_Source is not Made In House;Also currently there are a lot of entries with the same Stock_Catalog_Number but having different Stock_Name;Lots of entries have slightly different Stock_Name which can be propably be amalgamated - Jeff/George are currently going over the list.	2002-11-20 15:09:00	Lab Object	Stock
11	Pool	A pool of clones	Contains both FK_Transposon__Name and FK_Transposon__ID fields - this is redundant. All we need is the FK_Transponson__ID which can link us to the Transposon table via Transposon.Transposon_ID	2002-11-20 16:13:44	Lab Process	Pool
12	Transposon	Transposons	Currently only contains one record	2002-11-20 16:33:46	General	Transposon
15	Clone_Sequence	Stores the actual sequences along with other statistics and comments/notes	Finished cleaning up the Clone_Sequence_Comments field;Next step is to get rid of the FK_Note__ID field	2002-11-27 10:15:34	Application Specific	Clone_Sequence

21	ConcentrationRun	Correlates the plate ID and equipment ID for the concentration information of the individual wells from the Concentraions table	1 record has empty value for CalibrationFunction - probably should be set to n/a as well	2002-11-21 11:31:00	Application Specific	ConcentrationRun
23	Concentrations	Concentration of the wells	Currently the Units field is a varchar - probably should make it into an enum	2002-11-21 11:36:31	\N	Concentrations
24	Contact	Contacts for GSC	There are records that contain no Contact_Name - perhaps this is because the organization itself is the contact - still maybe better to make the Contact_Name field non-nullable; Also there is a contact called nobody - what is this for; There are multiple records that contain the same contact name and if fact they are the same person - the difference is they belong to a different organzation - this could cause data inconsistency and duplicate data - It will be better to create a new table called Person that actually stores the personal info like name, personal phone, personal email, personal address, etc and hence link the Contact table to the Person table via a FK_Person__ID - this will also help to remove various other personal related fields from the Contact table; There are also various fields related to the workplae info like Work_Address, Work_City etc - perhaps this can be removed as well since we already have a link to the Organization table via FK_Organization__ID;	2002-11-21 11:52:40	General	Contact
25	Contaminant	Contaminants found in wells during sequence runs	OK	2002-11-21 12:44:29	General	Contaminant
26	Contamination	Contaminations that could be found during sequence runs	Are the only 2 records in the table the same thing	2002-11-21 13:01:44	Application Specific	Contamination

30	Employee	GSC employees - users of the alDente system	Other than some info like positions are outdated/inaccurate, in general the table is fine	2002-11-21 13:55:52	Lab Object	Employee
31	Equipment	Equipments in the lab	There are equipments that have the same Serial_Number but have different Equipment_Name - in some cases this is because of having different equipment number but this info is already in the Equipment_Number field and so should not appear in Equipment_Name - worth to look into; Also there are equipments that have no FK_Stock__ID - ok or not	2002-11-21 14:11:18	Lab Object	Equipment
32	Error_Check	Error checking criteria for database fields	Not understand how this table is used;There are records in the table that are not even referencing a table from the database or are some testing data;Also most records are for the seqtest database - wonder whether this is an obsolete table	2002-11-21 14:22:20	\N	Error_Check

37	Gel	Gel run for plates	Data looks pretty incomplete	2002-11-21 14:49:31	\N	Gel
39	Lab_Protocol	Protocols created by lab administrators to be used in the lab	There are few protocols that links to FK_Employee__ID of zero - since there is no such employees this should be fixed	2002-11-21 15:53:37	General	Lab_Protocol
40	Library	Information about a proposed collection/library.	There are libraries that do not have Library_Source_Name - whether it is a good idea to make this a required field; Also no records has a FK_Vector__ID - they all link to the Vector table via FK_Vector__Name - hence probably can remove the FK_Vector__ID field	2002-11-21 16:25:34	General	Collection
41	LibraryPrimer	Assign a primer to a library. Once done adding primers, click skip to go to the next form.	There are records that contain no FK_Library__Name - should look into it	2002-11-21 16:33:52	Join	LibraryPrimer
42	LibraryProgress	Progess/status of libraries	Looks like this table is not updated often - in fact the only progress in the table is Created;Need to determine whether this table will be continued to be used and if so probably so frequently track the progress - perhaps should create a new field that is a enum of different progresses and use the existing LibraryProgress_Comments field to store extra detail info	2002-11-21 16:39:23	\N	LibraryProgress
43	Machine_Default	Stores default machine configurations for the sequencers	With the new addition of the sample sheet tables like SS_Config and SS_Option, many fields in this table can be dropped; Also the information from other fields are stored in the Sequence_Batch table at the sequence batch level - Need to determine whether these fields can be removed from Machine_Default as well	2002-11-21 16:46:13	Settings	Machine_Default
44	Maintenance	Historical record for maintenance performed on machines	There are records with no Maintenance_Process - probably this should be a required field and perhaps even worth to make this an enum field	2002-11-21 17:01:06	Lab Process	Maintenance
45	Maintenance_Protocol	Detail steps for regular machine maintenance/services from the Service table	There are currently no records in this table, and in fact there are only 2 records in the Service table - Need to determine whether these tables are obsolete and if not then need to encourage users to use them	2002-11-21 17:19:57	\N	Maintenance_Protocol
46	Message	Messages	Seems like an obsolete table that no one is using anymore	2002-11-21 17:35:25	\N	Message
47	Misc_Item	Miscellaneous lab items	Contains no data	2002-11-21 17:42:51	Lab Object	Misc_Item
48	Mixture	Mixtures made from solutions	The older records do not have data for Units_Used - should backfill these data and make the Units_Used field not nullable	2002-11-21 17:47:36	Join	Mixture
