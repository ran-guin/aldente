To elute DNA, add either 30 uL or 50 uL Buffer EB to the centre of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 minute.  Use 30 uL of elution buffer if the amount of RNA template for cDNA synthesis was less than 50 ng, otherwise use 50 uL.   It is important to dispense the elution buffer directly onto the membrane, and not the sides of the column, to ensure complete elution of bound DNA.  If 30 uL of elution buffer is used, then wait one minute following application of the buffer before centrifugation.  The average eluate volume is 48 uL from 50 uL applied elution buffer or 28 uL from 30 uL.   Remove a 3 uL aliquot to a separate labeled tube for Agilent analysis of the amplified cDNA.\

2	Agilent quantitaion of amplified cDNA	AGILENT QUANTITATION OF AMPLIFIED cDNA\
\
1.  Prepare an Agilent DNA chip according to the instructions in the Agilent DNA Assay manual.  Add 1 L of the following to three of the chip sample wells: undiluted amplified cDNA at room temperature (no heating is required), and the cDNA at 1/5 and 1/10 dilutions.  Run the chip using the DNA-7500-Smear Assay setting (under the Smear options, not the dsDNA options).\
\
2.  When the run is finished, open the Single Well views of the three samples.  Choose the best DNA smear to use for the calculation of the cDNA concentration, keeping in mind that the DNA assay is optimized for concentrations of DNA between 0.5 and 50 ng/&#61549;L.  \
\
3.  Change the default settings under the Settings tab as follows:  Click on the Settings tab and then select the option that reads Global to change the settings for all samples.   Change the default settings to Minimum Peak Height = 1.0, Minimum Peak Width = 0.1, and Slope Threshold = 0.2.  Uncheck the box that reads Exclude Ladder.  After you click on OK, there will be a prompt asking Do you want to override custom well settings? - the answer is Yes.  \
\
4.  Under the Edit option of the main menu click on Copy Results Table.\
\
5.  Print a copy of the assay results for this cDNA sample, then close the Agilent Bio Sizing program.\
\
6. Open the Agilent DNA Assay Blank Template file, located within the SAGE folder of the GE lab in the TEMPLATES subfolder.  \
\
7.  Click on cell A1 in the top left corner of the file and use the Paste function under Edit to paste the results table into the blank template. \
\
8.  Click on the Totals box for the sum of the individual peak concentrations (column E).  The Excel program automatically calculates the total using the sum of all the numbers in a given column.   To remove the contribution of the two DNA markers to the total, go to the formula bar and change the parameters to exclude the values for the two markers. Change the range so that the first cell number is one more than that which corresponds to the lower marker peak and the second cell number is one less than that which corresponds to the upper marker peak.  For example, if the number corresponding to the value for the lower marker peak concentration falls within cell E5, then change the first cell number to E6 in the formula bar.  Be careful to select the cell number which corresponds to the row number in the Excel file, and not the peak number of the smear (i.e. cell E5 corresponds to the row 5, column E cell of the Excel file).  After the formula range has been changed then move the cursor to the end of the formula (after the second parentheses) and press the Enter key.  The total DNA concentration is now corrected to reflect the concentration of the cDNA sample only.  The entire cDNA yield of the sample is displayed as either the yield per 28 &#61549;L or 48 &#61549;L eluate.\
\
9.  Save the quantitation table using the Save as function and store in the Agilent cDNA Quantitations folder within the SAGE-Lite folder. DO NOT OVERWRITE THE BLANK TEMPLATE FILE.    When closing the blank template file and the prompt asks Do you want to save the changes you made to Agilent DNA Assay Blank Template, choose no.   \
\
10.   Before proceeding with the NlaIII digestion, review the DNA smear profile and cDNA estimate results with Jas.  The amplified cDNA yield will vary depending on the RNA sample.  A minimum of 50 ng amplified cDNA is suggested to continue with the SAGE-Lite procedure.  \

1	Hyb Samples to GeneChip	Obtain labeled DNAhyb cocktail mix from the -20oC and thaw.  Vortex then briefly spin down to collect solution at the bottom of the tube.\
\
Heat the tubes to 95oC for 10 minutes in the Eppendorf ThermomixerR heat block.\
\
Remove tubes from the heat block and quick spin, vortex then quick spin before \
incubating the tubes in the Fisher Isotemp 125D heat block at 49oC for 1 min and 20sec.\
\
Take the first sample to be hybridized from the 49oC heat block and pipette up and down 5 times to dissolve any precipitate on the bottom of the tube.\
\
Take its correspondingly labeled array and fill with 200 uL of the hybridization mix.  Place remaining hybridization mix on ice.\
Do the same with the rest of the samples.\
Once arrays have been filled with the hybridization mix, stick Tough Spots to each septa of all the arrays.  This prevents leaks, if any, during the overnight hybridization.\
\
Place the probe arrays into the Hybridization Oven set to 50oC.  Load probe arrays in a balanced configuration around the axis to avoid stress on the motor.\
\
Rotate at 60 rpm for 18 hours at 50oC. The Hybridization temperature is 50oC. This temperature is different from 10K, 100K, and 500K Assays.\
\
Fill in the hybridization time sheets taped to the oven with the date, initials, # of chips hybridized, and hybridization start time.\
\
Return remaining hybridization mix to 20oC.  Put away reagents.\

5	Loading the Gel-Dye Matrix.	Take a new RNA Assay chip out of its sealed bag.  Place the chip on the Chip Priming Station.  Pipette 9ul of the gel-dye mix at the bottom of the well marked G and dispense the gel-dye mix.  Set the timer for 30sec.  Make sure the plunger is at 1ml then close the Chip Priming Station.  The lock of the latch will click when the Priming Staion is closed correctly.  Press the plunger until it is held by the syringe.  Wait for exactly 30sec then release the plunger with the clip release mechanism.  Wait for 5sec, then slowly pull back the plunger to the 1ml position.  Open the Chip Priming Station.

 An acceptable OD should fall within this range: 0.9 to 1.4. DNA yield equivalent = 4.5 to 7.0 &#956;g/&#956;L\
This OD range is based on the use of a conventional UV spectrophotometer plate reader and assumes a path length of 1 cm.\
 The OD260/OD280 ratio should be between 1.8 and 2.0.\
Do not proceed if this metric falls outside of this range.\
 The OD320 measurement should be very close to zero (&#8804; 0.1).\
