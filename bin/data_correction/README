Data correction scripts are used to correct or edit data more easily.

delete_replace.pl   - used to delete current records in the database (may replace one value with another optionally)
                    - this method also displays current references to the object identified, so can be used to find references to an object in the database.

change_project.pl   - used to move libraries from one project to another.  Generally frowned upon, this may be necessary periodically.
                    - this method will move all data in the Projects directory under one project and move it to the new project (which should already exist).
