This is particularly valuable to monitor the distribution of large numbers of tasks. It also provides proves very useful in optimizing laboratory procedure by allowing specific processes, reagents, or equipment to be correlated with data quality - something that can quickly identify troublesome aspects such as contaminated reagents, malfunctioning equipment, or ineffective processes.</p><p>Plate Tracking as a whole may be broken down into a number of common tasks performed on a computer or utilizing a barcode scanner:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1806"></a>Creation of Plates</h3></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1809"></a>Protocol Specification</h3><p>Detailed Protocols may be created and edited directly on the web using the Protocol interface which allows lab administrators to specify exactly what steps are to be monitored, and what types of information is expected. (eg. if a piece of equipment or a solution is to be scanned during a step)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1814"></a>Protocol Tracking</h3><p>Once a Protocol has been defined, lab users can then enter the protocol and are prompted step-by-step as they work through the protocol, generally requiring the user only to scan equipment or solutions used. Within this protocol, users may add notes to plates, fail individual plates (while working with a large set to begin with), or skip steps if desired.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1819"></a>Viewing Plate Information</h3><p>At various times it is valuable for users to be able to view or edit information regarding plates that they are working with. Some examples of this include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1825"></a>Plate History</h3><p>Viewing a History of procedures which have been carried out on a plate (including those carried out on parent plates)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1830"></a>Plate Ancestry</h3><p>Viewing the ancestry of plates allows users to see all plates related to a given plate ranging from the original plate generated from the library to all daughter plates as they are transferred or aliquoted out.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><h3><a name="d0e1835"></a>Tracking No Grows, Slow Grows and Unused Wells</h3><p>This allows users to check or to edit particular wells which are noted to be 'No Grows' or 'Slow Grows', or to specify certain wells that are unused for some reason. These values will normally be carried on to any daughter plates in the future.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch08s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3.&nbsp;Transferring Plates&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Adding comments or notes</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
