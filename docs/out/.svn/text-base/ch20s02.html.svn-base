The period between releases will vary depending upon the current requirements in the lab and their respective priority.</p><p>The release cycle itself consists of the following 4 phases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Requirements Elicitation</strong></span></p><p>This is not intended to be comprehensive at the outset, but simply sufficient to establish a rough guideline of ongoing requests and associated priorities. The goal is to establish an agreed upon timeline and short list of activities upon which to focus. This list will generally be made up of 'critical' issues (which will always be included in the following release) as well as issues of lesser importance which will may be excluded from the scope of the release depending upon progress along estimated timelines. Small scale issues will simply be addressed individually with minimal documentation. Larger scale issues will be associated with a 'work package' which will be documented in more detail, clarifying requirements and a coarse breakdown of time estimates for development.</p><p>During this period LIMS staff may also spend some time on general research and development in the aim of identifying design strategies that may improve the system down the road.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Development</strong></span></p><p>This stage itself involves a recursive iteration through the following stages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Requirements clarification - tweaking requirements as required upon each iteration of development</p></li><li><p>Design - often in conjunction with other LIMS developers. This may involve generating pseudocode as well as writing/upgrading documentation and use cases.</p></li><li><p>Code development</p></li><li><p>Testing - going over the functionality to ensure that the feature operates as expected. (this should be done first by the developer himself, and then with the user)</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Testing</strong></span></p><p>Testing itself is done in three stages (in addition to the testing that is done inherently during the development process) prior to the production release of each version of the LIMS.</p><p>In addition to the testing protocol below, most API methods and some methods within the LIMS core are automatically tested daily for consistency. This discovers bugs introduced to individual methods which result in different output values. See 'Automated Testing' section for more information.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>LIMS testing</p><p>Using the LIMS SOP - carried out by LIMS developers - this encompasses a full range of user functionality.</p></li><li><p>Beta testing</p><p>Testing can often be more effective when carried out by lab users themselves, taking into consideration possible variations in the way tasks are carried out on the system. This process should be carried out by lab personnel, or dedicated QA personnel over a period of a few days.</p></li><li><p>Bug fixing.</p><p>The LIMS team should carry out bug fixes only after the beta testing process is complete. This step and the previous step should be completed recursively until the beta testing is completed without errors.</p></li><li><p>Acceptance testing</p><p>This process should be carried out by the lab personnel for each group using the LIMS. Upon the completion of the acceptance testing without bugs, the individual groups should 'sign off' on the new release. (If bugs are found once all of the acceptance testing is complete, then the LIMS group should fix the bugs and another round of acceptance testing completed).</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Release</strong></span></p><p>The release itself is generally targetted to occur on a weekend to allow for the LIMS group to monitor the successful rebuilding of the system. Because the database is restored cleanly from scratch, and the code installed from scratch, this allows time to address issues that may arise from storage ceilings or unforeseen obstacles from the installation process which are difficult to test effectively.</p></li></ul></div><p>For more information on protocols for Development or Releasing specific to developers, please see 'Development / Release Protocols' section.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch20s01.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch20.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch20s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1.&nbsp;Design Issues Decisions&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Automated Testing</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
