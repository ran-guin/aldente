For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>An infinite loop in the code causing the web page forever to load.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Major: </em></span> The defect impacts the operation/functionality of the system in major ways. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>An error in the SQL INSERT query causing Lab administrators cannot create new libraries.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Minor: </em></span> The defect impacts the operation/functionality of the system in minor ways. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>A bug in the JavaScript code causing the radio buttons in the No Grows/Slow Grows page not able to batch select/deselect checkboxes.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>After scanning in a stock catalog number, the New Stock form does not have information pre-filled.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Cosmetic: </em></span> The defect does not impact the operation/functionality of the system in any ways. It is merely a cosmetic/user-interface problem. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Spelling mistakes.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>he layout on the webpage is skewed-up, even though all the functionalities/features can still be accessed.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For enhancements:</em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Fatal: </em></span>The enhancement have a system-wide effect or requires a significant amount of code to be rewritten. In general the risk will be high; the enhancement will require a fair amount of work and extremely vigourous testing, and failure to do so will likely have a fatal effect on the system if the enhancement is made into the production release. An extensive design/code review with another developer is required. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Implements MySQL transactions.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Major: </em></span> The enhancement affects a relatively large portion of the system. In general there will be a fair amount of risks involved; the enhancement will require a fair amount of work and very throughout testing. There should be at least brief design/code review with another developer. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Implements the new generate_form() routine for generating HTML forms.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Minor: </em></span> The enhancement affects a small portion of the system. In general there will be little risks involved; the enhancement should be relatively easy to be implemented and relatively throughout testing will be required. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Adding the ability in the Plates home page to find plates by rack.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Cosmetic: </em></span> The enhancement just affects the visual appearance of the system. ;In general there should be almost no risk involved; the enhancement should be extremely easy to be implemented and minimal testing will be required. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Change the toggling colour in the HTML forms to improve the forms apperance.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For Maintenance </em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Fatal: </em></span> The maintenance will cause the lab not to be able to operate for a period of time and there is no other way around this. These type of maintenance must be planned carefully ahead of time to minimize the systems down-time. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Migrating the alDente system from web03/athena to seqdb01.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Major: </em></span> The maintenance will have major impacts on the operation of the lab, although the lab should still be fully functional. These type of maintenance is somewhat risky as well. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>paraAltering the indexing of the Clone_Sequence table.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Minor: </em></span> The maintenace will have minor impacts on the operation of the lab.

Usually the defect will have system-wide impact. Must be resolved immediately in the current production release. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>alDente homepage cannot be loaded.</p></li><li><p>Sample sheets cannot be generated when the lab is about to start a sequence run.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>High</em></span>The defect has no workarounds but the lab can still operate for a period of time while waiting the defect to be resolved. Usually the defect will only affect a small number of users. Should be resolved ASAP in the current production release. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Last 24 Hours page not working; however no one is desperately waiting for the analysis results.</p></li><li><p>Error message showing up during the protocol steps preventing an individual lab user from continuing his/her experiment.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Medium</em></span>The defect has workarounds and the lab can still operate without the defect being resolved. However, the defect reduces the ease to use the system and thus affects users work productivity in major ways. Should be resolved in the next production release. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Lab administrators cannot create new employees - they have to come to the developers in order to fulfill the task.</p></li><li><p>Plates cannot be deleted from the "Delete or Annote Recent Plates" button from the homepage; however, users can still scan in the plates and delete them from the multi-record edit page.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Low</em></span>The defect has workarounds and the lab can still operate without the defect being resolved. At most, the defect should only affect the users work productivity in minor ways. May be resolved in any future product releases as time permits. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Users cannot scan their employee barcode (with password) to quickly relogin. ;Instead, they have to go back to the Re-Login page and login from there.</p></li><li><p>JavaScript text searching for libaries are not working; instead the users need to scroll down the popup menu to find the library they want.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For enhancements:</em></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Critical</em></span>The enhancement is critical to the operation of the lab and will be implemented in the next production release which needs to be available to the lab ASAP. (i.e. the release date will be earlier than the original scheduled/anticipated release date). Note that this should almost never happen as this introduces sigificant risk into the system. Instead, the developers should always be given advanced notice about any new features that needed to be implemented. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Need to be able to generate sample sheets for the new sequencer and the lab needs to be able to use this sequencer in a few days.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>High</em></span>The enhancement is very important to the operation of the lab and will be implemented in the next production release. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A new library submission process for users to submit new libraries.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Medium</em></span>The enhancement is somewhat important to the operation of the lab and preferrably be implemented in the next production release if possible. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Catalog number searching when receiving stock - allowing most information to be pre-filled.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Low</em></span>The enhancement is the 'nice-to-have' type which can be implemented in any future production releases if time permits. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Adding a button to the multi-record edit page allowing batch selecting of records.</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For maintenance:</em></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Critical</em></span>Disaster time! The lab is not operating and the maintenance must be performed immediately. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>MySQL data folder is full and no more queries can be issued against the database.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>High</em></span>The maintenance should be addresses ASAP or else it will soon jeopardize the normal operation of the lab. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/home/sequence directory has exceed 90% disk usage.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Medium</em></span>The maintenance is relatively important to the operation of the lab and should be addressed in the near future. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Generate a list of missing trace files in /home/sequence and see if they can be recoved from system backups.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Low</em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Clean up unused tables in the sequence database.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p> </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>Note that although Critical/High issues tend to be Fatal/Major while Medium/Low issues tend to be Minor/Cosmetic, there can be exceptions.
