From each library a number of plates will typically be made up each of which should be associated with ONE and ONLY ONE Library.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1121"></a>2.1.&nbsp;What sort of information do we keep on Libraries</h3></div></div></div><p>There is quite a bit of information that we would like to store for each library, so it would be helpful if you were able to acquire this information before attempting to create it. This will remove the necessity of returning at a later date and adding the information (which can quite easily be neglected). In a pinch however, it is possible to create a library with a minimum of information, if there is a need to generate Plates/Sample Sheets before further information is available.</p><h4><a name="d0e1126"></a>The following information is generally required for the library :</h4><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="opencircle"><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Name</em></span> - This MUST be 5 alpha-numeric characters. Though it is nice to keep this name somewhat meaningful, this is an Identification field, and is not meant to act as a human-readable reference to a library. In theory, this could be simply a 5 digit number which, though meaningless to a user, provides the database with an index to this particular library. Often the format will be simply two letters followed by an incrementing number. (such as 'CN001','CN002' for the first two Cryptococus Neoformans libraries), though if it is useful, the positions of numbers and letters is flexible (ie. spgpW or P2001)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>FullName</em></span> -This is usually set to a brief, but more meaningful name for the library</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Type</em></span> -This is usually set to indicate whether the library is an EST,cDNA or SAGE Library</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Vector</em></span> - This indicates the vector that is used. If this vector is already in the database, no further info is required. However, there is information that is also required for the Vector if it a new one. If no Vector exists for a given library, use the Vector Name: 'Test'</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Organism</em></span> - This indicates the organism from which the library is created</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Source</em></span> - This indicates where the library originated (eg Jim Kronstad, UBC)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Source Name</em></span> - This is the name given the library by the original source listed above</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>5Prime_Restriction_Site</em></span> - This indicates the name of the Restriction Enzyme if appropriate</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>3Prime_Restriction_Site</em></span> - This indicates the name of the Restriction Enzyme if appropriate in the 3' direction</p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Host</em></span> - This indicates the Host Cells (eg.

From here, by clicking on 'Libraries' at the top of the page, one is given a list of current libraries and given the option to add a new Library. You are then given a form to fill out which will include the information indicated above. Generally this should be filled in as completely as possible. Though it is sometimes easier to leave information blank at first with the intention of filling it in at a later date, this is discouraged as this later step is all too often neglected, and the database remains in part incomplete.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1201"></a>2.3.&nbsp;How can I view information on a Library?</h3></div></div></div><p>By simply clicking on the 'Library' icon at the top of the page, you will be given a choice to view various items including Libraries at the top of the page.
