After installation of the external submission page, you must 
configure the page by running setup.pl in the conf directory.

Note to users with an internal LIMS server:

You must install cron jobs that will mirror publish and submission
directories. The submissions directory (for submissions) and the Projects
directory (for publishing) have already been created for you.

An example of a script that will mirror published documents is provided
at /root/publish_mirror.pl.
